# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-US-Accidents
 TODO - talk about EDA
 TODO - talk about the dataset (source, what it contains, how it will be useful)
   - Kaggle
   - Information about accidents
   - Can be useful to prevent accidents
  
  ## Data Preparation and Cleaning

- Load the file using Pandas
- Look at some information about the data & the columns
- Fix any missing or incorrect values
  
 ## Exploratory Analysis and Visualization

- Columns we will analyze:
  1. City
  2. Start Time
  3. Start Lat, Start Lng
  4. Temperature
  5. Weather Condition
  
 ## Ask and Answer Questions

 1. Are there more accidents in warmer or colder areas?
 2. Which 5 states have the highest number of accidents? How about per capita?
 3. Does New York show up in the data?
 If yes, why is the count lower if it is the most populated city?
 4. Among the top 100 cities in number of accidents, which states do they belong to most frequently?
 5. What time of the day are accidents most frequent in?
 6. Which days of the week have the most accidents?
 7. Which months have the most accidents?
 8. What is the trend of accidents year over year (decreasing/increasing)? 
 
 ## Summary

Insights:
- No data for New York
- The number of accidents per city decreases exponentially
- Less than 5% of cities have more than 1000 yearly accidents
- Over 1200 cities have reported just one accident (need to investigate)
